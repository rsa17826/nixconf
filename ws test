What you’re looking for is **Hyprland’s “initial workspace tracking”** feature.
It does *exactly* this: it remembers the workspace where an app was **launched**, even if the window appears later after you’ve already switched away.

So you don’t need a visual placeholder window — Hyprland will still tile the window on the workspace you started it from.

---

## ✅ Enable initial workspace tracking

Add this to your `hyprland.conf`:

```ini
misc {
    initial_workspace_tracking = true
}
```

Or, if you don’t use blocks:

```ini
misc:initial_workspace_tracking = true
```

Reload Hyprland (`hyprctl reload`).

---

## 🧠 How it works

With this enabled:

1. You go to **workspace 2**
2. You launch an app (e.g. `firefox`)
3. Before the window appears, you switch back to **workspace 1**
4. When Firefox finally opens, it **still appears tiled on workspace 2**

No waiting, no racing the app startup.

---

## 📌 Notes / requirements

* Requires a **relatively recent Hyprland version** (it’s been stable for a while now)
* Works with:

  * slow apps
  * Electron apps
  * GTK/Qt apps
* This is **not** the same as:

  * window swallowing
  * rules like `workspace = 2`

It’s automatic and per-launch.

---

## 🧪 Optional: verify it’s working

You can test with something slow:

```bash
sleep 2 && alacritty
```

Launch it on WS2, immediately switch away — it should still land on WS2.

---

If you *do* want a **visual placeholder / ghost tile** (some tiling WMs experiment with that), Hyprland currently doesn’t support that concept — but in practice, `initial_workspace_tracking` solves the real problem cleanly.

If you want, I can also show:

* how this interacts with `windowrulev2`
* or how to force specific apps to *always* open on certain workspaces
